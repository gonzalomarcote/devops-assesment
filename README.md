Gonzo's DevOps assesment

### 1. Docker-ayes
A Dockerfile that runs Litecoin 0.18.1 in a container.
I have been checking some info, specifically [here](https://github.com/uphold/docker-litecoin-core) and [here](https://github.com/NicolasDorier/docker-bitcoin), but just to gather some info to build the entrypoint script and finally I have created my own solution. 

Build it with:  
`docker build . -t "litecoin:0.18.1"` 

Run it with:  
`docker run --name my-litecoin -d -p 9332:9332 -p 9333:9333 -p 19332:19332 -p 19333:19333 -p 19444:19444 litecoin:0.18.1` 

You can check logs with:  
`docker logs my-litecoin -f` 

Push it and pull it to your favorite registry. In my case:  
`docker tag litecoin:0.18.1 0881XXXXXX.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/stuff/litecoin:0.18.1` 
`docker push 0881XXXXXX.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/stuff/litecoin:10.18.1` 

### 2. K8s FTW
Kubernetes StatefulSet to run the above, using persistent volume claims and resource limits. 
I have created one simple `litecoin.yaml` StatefulSet with one persistent volume for the previous litecoin container.  
I have also defined some limits to the container with a memory request of `256Mi` and a CPU ussage of Â¼ of a core. And also I have set a sum of limited resources for all of its containers in the `limits` section.  

### 3. All the continuouses 
A simple build and deployment pipeline for the above using groovy/Jenkinsfile, Travis CI or Gitlab CI.  
As I am always using Jenkins and nowadays I am using GitHub Actions I have decided to build a simple pipeline in GitHub Actions to build and deploy the previous litecoin example. You can find it in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` and have comments inline.
